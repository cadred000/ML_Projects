Machine Learning with PyTorch projects

This was a group project for the CSE575 Statistical Machine Learning class I took at ASU. My job was to build a Bayesian Neural Network to compare with CNN's and Vision Transformers that were built by the other group members. The final paper with results is available as well as the code for the BNN.
