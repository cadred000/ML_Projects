# Heart Disease Machine Learning Project for MAT421

This was my first machine learning project.  It was for my Numerical Python class as required for my Applied Mathematics BS.  The results were sub-optimal but I did get my feet wet. I took what I learned from this and moved forward to bigger and better projects.
