#Periodic Time Series Prediction Challenge

This was a project for my Machine Learning class at ASU. I developed a model to predict future values in Periodic Time Series data. The goal was to minimize the MSE for forecasting the time series.  Included are the plots and code for my submission.  The MSE was 0.00241 for the testing data.  This competition was hosted on Kaggle as cse-575-project-2.
