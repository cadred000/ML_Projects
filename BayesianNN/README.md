This was a group project for the CSE575 Statistical Machine Learning class I took in the Fall semester of '24 at ASU. My job was to create a Bayesian Neural Network to classify aerial images and compare with various types of models that the other members of the group created. The final paper, the presentation slides and the code for the BNN are available in this repo.
